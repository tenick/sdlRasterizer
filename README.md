# sdlRasterizer
2nd c++ project

rasterizer made only using sdl and pure software/CPU rendering no GPU

sdl only used for creating window and drawing individual pixels on that window

rasterizer features:

- Illumination/shading via point light on camera
- Texture mapping of cube
- Simple .OBJ file parser/renderer (can only parse/render obj with vertices and triangular faces)
- Simple clipping
- Back-face culling
- Custom scene creation (only with cubes, teapots, and cows lol)
